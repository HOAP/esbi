Hunter Outpatient Alcohol Project (HOAP)
========================================

This is a short survey to monitor the progress of outpatients being treated for
alcohol dependence in the Hunter area.

The version on the 'master' branch is a reduced set of the whole instrument,
called the ESBI, which is used for demonstration purposes.

The version that was administered to the participants is available on the
'HOAPv1' branch.

Requirements
------------

* Ruby 1.9 or later
* Bundler
* PostgeSQL 9.0 or later
* Redis 2.0 or later
* A webserver such as Apache or nginx

Installation
------------

# Clone the repository to the location you wish to run the survey from.
# Edit config/database.yml with the connection details for your database.
# Run @bundle install@ to install all of the required Ruby libraries.
# Edit db/seeds.rb and change the details for the default admin user.
# Run @rake db:setup@ to create the database tables and enter the
  data required to run the survey.
# Configure the Unicorn application server by editing config/unicorn.conf.rb
  - it is currently configured to listen on a socket file, but this can be
  changed to listen on a network port. It is recommended that you use
  a web server such as Apache or nginx in front of Unicorn, proxying
  connections to Unicorn for the survey, and serving the static files from
  'public' folder.
# Start the application @bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.cong.rb@

Heroku
------

This survey was run publicly using the Heroku application hosting service,
and so is pretty much ready to go. You just need to create your account,
create the application, and push this repository. It should handle a light
load and a couple of hundred applicants without problems on the free tier.
