  Some of the questions you answered regarding your drinking come from the
  Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, a questionnaire developed by the
  World Health Organisation to determine whether a person's drinking might be
  becoming problematic.

%p.audit_level
  Your AUDIT score was
  %span.report= @participant.audit

%p{:class => audit_class(@participant.audit, 0)}
  MODERATE DRINKING (0-7) Low risk of alcohol related harm.

%p{:class => audit_class(@participant.audit, 1)}
  HAZARDOUS DRINKING (8-14) High risk of experiencing alcohol related harm and
  some people in this range may already be experiencing significant harm.

%p{:class => audit_class(@participant.audit, 2)}
  HARMFUL DRINKING (15-19) A person scoring in this range will already be
  experiencing significant alcohol related harm.

%p{:class => audit_class(@participant.audit, 3)}
  ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE (20-40) A person scoring in this range may be alcohol
  dependent and advised to have a clinical assessment of their drinking. To
  find out some services that might be useful go to the

  The main way to reduce your risk level (and AUDIT score) is to reduce the
  number of drinks you consume per occasion. You may like to check out the
  = link_to 'TIPS', tips_path(@participant.key)
  section for ideas on reducing your consumption.

  %span.report= number_to_currency @participant.money[0]

  on alcohol in the last year.

  validated clinical measure of the severity of alcohol dependence.

%p
  Generally speaking, the higher the score the more reason for concern that
  your drinking may be out of control. Your score was
  %strong= @participant.ldq
  and suggests that...
