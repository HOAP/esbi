          Your estimated Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) for your heaviest drinking
          occasion is
          %span.report #{@participant.bac}%

        %p
          Your BAC is an indication of how intoxicated you are, with a higher BAC
          corresponding with a greater likelihood of experiencing alcohol-related
          harm, especially when driving.

        %p
          This estimate takes into account your gender, weight, the number of
          standard drinks consumed and the number of hours over which you
          reported drinking this amount.
