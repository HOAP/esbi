  %h3 Your Blood Alcohol Content

    %tr
      %td
        %p
          Your estimated Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) for your heaviest drinking
          occasion is
          %span.report #{@participant.bac}%

        %p
          Your BAC is an indication of how intoxicated you are, with a higher BAC
          corresponding with a greater likelihood of experiencing alcohol-related
          harm, especially when driving.

        %p
          This estimate takes into account your gender, weight, the number of
          standard drinks consumed and the number of hours over which you
          reported drinking this amount.

  %h3 Your Risk Of Alcohol Dependence

  %p
    How in control of your drinking are you? The 10 questions you answered at the
    end of the questionnaire were from the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire, a
    validated clinical measure of the severity of alcohol dependence.

  %p
    Generally speaking, the higher the score the more reason for concern that
    your drinking may be out of control. Your score was
    %strong= @participant.ldq
    and suggests that...

    != ldq_suggestion(@participant.ldq)
