        Some of the questions you answered regarding your drinking come from the
        Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, a questionnaire developed by the
        World Health Organisation to determine whether a person's drinking might be
        becoming problematic.

      %p.audit_level
        Your AUDIT score was
        %span.report= @participant.audit

      - if @participant.audit <= 7
        %p{:class => audit_class(@participant.audit, 0)}
          MODERATE DRINKING (0-7) Low risk of alcohol related harm.
          %br
          Of course, the above does not apply to women who are pregnant, planning
          a pregnancy or who are breastfeeding. In these cases, not drinking is
          the safest option<sup>1</sup>.
      - elsif @participant.audit <= 14
        %p{:class => audit_class(@participant.audit, 1)}
          HAZARDOUS DRINKING (8-14) High risk of experiencing alcohol related harm and
          some people in this range may already be experiencing significant harm.
      - elsif @participant.audit <= 19
        %p{:class => audit_class(@participant.audit, 2)}
          HARMFUL DRINKING (15-19) A person scoring in this range will already be
          experiencing significant alcohol related harm.
      - else
        %p{:class => audit_class(@participant.audit, 3)}
          ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE (20-40) A person scoring in this range may be
          alcohol dependent and advised to have a clinical assessment of their
          drinking. For a list of services that might be useful go to the
          SUPPORT section on the next page.

        The main way to reduce your risk level (and AUDIT score) is to reduce the
        number of drinks you consume per occasion. You may like to check out the
        TIPS section on the next page for ideas on reducing your consumption.
